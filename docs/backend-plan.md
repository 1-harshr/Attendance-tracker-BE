# MVP Attendance Tracker App: Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview

You’ll build a simple, reliable attendance tracker for a small team (10–20 users), using an Android app for employees and a web portal for admins. The app will validate attendance using Android’s location permissions, with all geofence logic handled on the device.

## 2. Core Components

### A. Backend (API \& Database)

- **User Authentication:** Simple token-based login for employees and admins.
- **Employee Management:** CRUD operations for employee records.
- **Attendance Management:** Endpoints for check-in/out, with location and time data.
- **Reporting:** Generate and export attendance reports (Excel).
- **Admin Portal:** Web interface for admin tasks.


### B. Android App

- **Login Screen:** Employee authentication.
- **Attendance Screen:**
    - Check-in/Check-out buttons.
    - Location permission prompt.
    - Only allow attendance if within office radius.
- **Attendance History:** View daily/monthly records.
- **Notifications:** Reminders for check-in/out.


## 3. API Endpoint Plan

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Auth Required |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :--: |
| /auth/login | POST | User login, returns token | No |
| /employees | GET | List all employees (admin) | Yes |
| /employees | POST | Add new employee (admin) | Yes |
| /employees/{id} | GET | Get employee details | Yes |
| /employees/{id} | PUT | Update employee info (admin) | Yes |
| /employees/{id} | DELETE | Deactivate/delete employee (admin) | Yes |
| /attendance/checkin | POST | Employee check-in (location, time, distance) | Yes |
| /attendance/checkout | POST | Employee check-out (location, time, distance) | Yes |
| /attendance | GET | Get attendance records (filter by date/employee) | Yes |
| /attendance/{id} | PUT | Admin edits/overrides attendance | Yes |
| /reports/attendance | GET | Export attendance reports (Excel) | Yes |

## 4. Implementation Steps

### 1. **Backend Setup**

- Choose stack (Node.js/Express, Django, etc.).
- Design database schema: Employees, Attendance Logs.
- Implement authentication and core API endpoints.
- Test endpoints with sample data.


### 2. **Admin Web Portal**

- Build simple dashboard (React, Angular, or plain HTML/JS).
- Integrate with backend for employee and attendance management.
- Add report export functionality.


### 3. **Android App**

- Set up project with login and attendance screens.
- Implement location permission and validation logic.
- Integrate with backend for attendance marking and history.
- Add basic notifications.


### 4. **Testing \& Deployment**

- Test end-to-end flows with real devices.
- Deploy backend (cloud/VPS) and web portal.
- Distribute app to employees (internal testing or Play Store).


## 5. Configuration \& Security Notes

- **Office Location/Radius:** Hardcode in app or fetch from a config endpoint if needed.
- **Token Security:** Use HTTPS for all API calls.
- **Data Privacy:** Clearly inform users about location usage.


## 6. Future Improvements (For Reference)

- Selfie/photo capture at check-in.
- Attendance correction requests.
- Leave management and holiday calendar.
- Enhanced security and offline support.
- Shift and multi-location support.
